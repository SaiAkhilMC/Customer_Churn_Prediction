In my customer churn prediction project, I began by conducting thorough data visualization to gain insights into the patterns and trends within the dataset. After a comprehensive understanding of the data, I employed logistic regression as the chosen machine learning algorithm for predicting customer churn. The logistic regression model yielded promising results, achieving an accuracy of 79.96%. This accuracy rate indicates the model's ability to correctly classify customers as either churning or not, providing a solid foundation for further analysis and potential implementation of retention strategies.
